You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight js %}
function xdr(url, method, data, callback, errback) {
    var req;
    
    if(XMLHttpRequest) {
        req = new XMLHttpRequest();
        if('withCredentials' in req) {
            req.open(method, url, true);
        	req.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/json");
            req.onerror = errback;
            req.onreadystatechange = function() {
                if (req.readyState === 4) {
                    if (req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400) {
                        callback(req.responseText);
                    } else {
                        errback(new Error('Response returned with non-OK status'));
                    }
                }
            };
            req.send(data);
        }
    } else if(XDomainRequest) {
        req = new XDomainRequest();
        req.open(method, url);
		req.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/json");
        req.onerror = errback;
        req.onload = function() {
            callback(req.responseText);
        };
        req.send(data);
    } else {
        errback(new Error('CORS not supported'));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
